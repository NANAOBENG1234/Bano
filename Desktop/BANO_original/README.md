# 🗺️ Campus Navigation System (BANO)

A smart campus navigation system designed to help students easily locate
lecture halls, departments, hostels, and other important facilities on
large university campuses.

This project was inspired by the challenges faced by Level 100 students
at the University of Ghana who often struggle to find lecture venues,
even when using Google Maps.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

University campuses are large and complex.  
New students, visitors, and even continuing students frequently:

- Get lost trying to locate lecture halls
- Arrive late for lectures due to navigation issues
- Struggle to identify departments and campus facilities

Existing map solutions are general-purpose and do not provide
campus-specific academic locations such as lecture rooms and departments.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The Campus Navigation System provides a **campus-focused map experience**
that allows users to:

- View a campus map with academic locations clearly marked
- Search for lecture halls, departments, and hostels
- Get directions to lecture venues similar to Google Maps
- Navigate the campus efficiently using their mobile phones or browsers

---

## 👥 Target Users

- Level 100 students
- Continuing students
- Visiting students
- University staff and campus visitors

---

## 🧩 System Overview

The system is designed with a modular architecture:

- **Frontend**  
  Displays the map interface and handles user interactions

- **Backend**  
  Manages campus location data and provides APIs to the frontend

- **Map Service**  
  Uses Google Maps (or a similar map API) for navigation and routing
